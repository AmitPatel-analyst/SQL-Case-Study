I recently came across a case study on the Kaggle website. As a data analyst, I found this challenge to be a great way to showcase my SQL skills and improve my problem-solving abilities.

Imported the dataset in SQL server with table name: credit_card_transcations             
Here is the link to download the credit card transactions [dataset](https://lnkd.in/dBkkCw2n)          
             

I used various SQL functions such as :                               
✅ Case When Statements           
✅ CTE            
✅ Joins         
✅ Logical Operator              
✅ Group by, Order by, Where         
✅ Aggregate functions Sum, Count                
✅ Date functions Datepart , Datename, Datediff               
✅ Window functions(DENSE_RANK, LAG)
