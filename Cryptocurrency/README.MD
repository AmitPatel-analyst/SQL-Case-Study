# Cryptocurrency Case Study


This repository contains the solutions for the Cryptocurrency case study. This case study is started by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program,in which I had learnt different SQL functions. I would like to thank Danny Ma to provide the Virtual Data apprenticeship program.
## Context

This entire SQL Simplified course focuses on a Cryptocurrency SQL Case Study.
In our fictitious case study - Danny's data mentors from the Data With Danny team have been busy trading cryptocurrency markets since 2017.

Our main purpose for this case study is to analyze the performance of the DWD mentors over time. 
We will accomplish this by writing SQL queries to utilize all available datasets to answer a series of realistic business questions.

Each case-study folder contains the following files
- A readme file explaining the problem statement and datasets used
- SQL file to create the schema and loading data
- .csv files containing the raw data for each table to import
- MD files which contains SQL queries answering the respective questions

You can find the solution [here](https://github.com/AmitPatel-analyst/SQL-Case-Study/blob/main/Cryptocurrency/Cryptocurrency%20Solutions.md)
**Note**: 
- Solutions are coded in **PostgreSQL**
