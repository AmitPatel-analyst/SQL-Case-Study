## Lab 5 of the SQL Simplified Labs!
  
Topic - Table joins are mandatory for all SQL queries that obtain columns from 2 or more different datasets. You will learn how to implement the most commonly used table joins and how to assess which type of table join to use with all available datasets in a cryptocurrency SQL case study.

    END
  ) AS total_quantity
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN members
  ON transactions.member_id = members.member_id

###  Question 3 - Multiple Table Joins
For this question - we will generate a single table output which solves a multi-part problem about the dollar cost average of BTC purchases.

Part 1: Calculate the Dollar Cost Average
		a) What is the dollar cost average (btc_dca) for all Bitcoin purchases by region for each calendar year?
Create a column called year_start and use the start of the calendar year
The dollar cost average calculation is btc_dca = SUM(quantity x price) / SUM(quantity)

Part 2: Yearly Dollar Cost Average Ranking
		b) Use this btc_dca value to generate a dca_ranking column for each year
The region with the lowest btc_dca each year has a rank of 1

Part 3: Dollar Cost Average Yearly Percentage Change
		c) Calculate the yearly percentage change in DCA for each region to 2 decimal places
This calculation is (current - previous) / previous
Finally order the output by region and year_start columns.
