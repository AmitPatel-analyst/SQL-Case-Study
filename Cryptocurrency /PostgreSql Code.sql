 /*
This lab is from the SQL Simplified series by Danny Ma. These labs will help you familiarize yourself with the most useful SQL techniques for data analysis. 
Learn how to create SQL queries and solve a series of common business problems in a cryptocurrency SQL case study.
*/

/*
This entire SQL Simplified course focuses on a Cryptocurrency SQL Case Study.
In our fictitious case study - Danny's data mentors from the Data With Danny team have been busy trading cryptocurrency markets since 2017.

Our main purpose for this case study is to analyze the performance of the DWD mentors over time. 
We will accomplish this by writing SQL queries to utilize all available datasets to answer a series of realistic business questions.
*/

Available Datasets:-
There are 3 data tables available to us in this database which we can use to run our SQL queries with:

1- members ( this table consists of information about the mentors from the Data With Danny team.)
--Show all the rows and columns from this table by running the below code 

SELECT * FROM members;

|Column Name		Description
|member_id	= 		unique id for each mentor
|first_name	= 		first name for each mentor
|region		= 		region where each mentor is from

2- prices (This table consists of daily price and volume information from January 2017 through to August 2021 for the 2 most popular cryptocurrency tickers: Bitcoin and Ethereum)

--Show all the rows and columns from this table by running the below code 

select * from prices;

|Column Name		Description
|ticker				= one of either BTC or ETH
|market_date	    = the date for each record
|price				= closing price at end of day
|open				= the opening price
|high				= the highest price for that day
|low				= the lowest price for that day
|volume				= the total volume traded
|change				= % change in daily price

3- transactions (This table consists of buy and sell transactions data for each trade made by the DWD mentors.)

--Show all the rows and columns from this table by running the below code 
select * from transactions;

|Column Name		Description
|txn_id				= unique ID for each transaction
|member_id			= member identifier for each trade
|ticker				= the ticker for each trade
|txn_date			= the date for each transaction
|txn_type			= either BUY or SELL
|quantity			= the total quantity for each trade
|percentage_fee		= % of total amount charged as fees
|txn_time			= the timestamp for each trade

/*
-- Creating these indexes after loading data
-- will make things run much faster!!!

CREATE INDEX ON prices (ticker, market_date);
CREATE INDEX ON transactions (txn_date, ticker);
CREATE INDEX ON transactions (txn_date, member_id);
CREATE INDEX ON transactions (member_id);
CREATE INDEX ON transactions (ticker);

				b)Return the output for Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum in price rank order.

WITH cte_rank AS (
SELECT
  ticker,
  market_date,
  price,

Topic - Table joins are mandatory for all SQL queries that obtain columns from 2 or more different datasets. You will learn how to implement the most commonly used table joins and how to assess which type of table join to use with all available datasets in a cryptocurrency SQL case study.

Question 1 - Which top 3 mentors have the most Bitcoin quantity? Return the first_name of the mentors and sort the output from highest to lowest total_quantity?

SELECT
  members.first_name,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN transactions.txn_type = 'BUY'  THEN transactions.quantity
      WHEN transactions.txn_type = 'SELL' THEN -transactions.quantity
    END
  ) AS total_quantity
FROM transactions
INNER JOIN members
  ON transactions.member_id = members.member_id
WHERE transactions.ticker = 'BTC'
GROUP BY members.first_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 3;

Question 2 - Show the market_date values which have less than 5 transactions? Sort the output in reverse chronological order.

SELECT
  prices.market_date,
  COUNT(transactions.txn_id) AS transaction_count
FROM prices
LEFT JOIN transactions
  ON prices.market_date = transactions.txn_date
  AND prices.ticker = transactions.ticker
GROUP BY prices.market_date
HAVING COUNT(transactions.txn_id) < 5
ORDER BY prices.market_date DESC;

Question 3 - Multiple Table Joins
For this question - we will generate a single table output which solves a multi-part problem about the dollar cost average of BTC purchases.

Part 1: Calculate the Dollar Cost Average
		a) What is the dollar cost average (btc_dca) for all Bitcoin purchases by region for each calendar year?
Create a column called year_start and use the start of the calendar year
The dollar cost average calculation is btc_dca = SUM(quantity x price) / SUM(quantity)

Part 2: Yearly Dollar Cost Average Ranking
		b) Use this btc_dca value to generate a dca_ranking column for each year
The region with the lowest btc_dca each year has a rank of 1

Part 3: Dollar Cost Average Yearly Percentage Change
		c) Calculate the yearly percentage change in DCA for each region to 2 decimal places
This calculation is (current - previous) / previous
Finally order the output by region and year_start columns.

WITH cte_dollar_cost_average AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('YEAR', transactions.txn_date)::DATE AS year_start,
    members.region,
    SUM(transactions.quantity * prices.price) / SUM(transactions.quantity) AS btc_dca
  FROM transactions
  INNER JOIN prices
    ON transactions.ticker = prices.ticker
    AND transactions.txn_date = prices.market_date
  INNER JOIN members
    ON transactions.member_id = members.member_id
  WHERE transactions.ticker = 'BTC'
    AND transactions.txn_type = 'BUY'
  GROUP BY year_start, members.region
),
cte_window_functions AS (
SELECT
  year_start,
  region,
  btc_dca,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY year_start
    ORDER BY btc_dca
  ) AS dca_ranking,
  LAG(btc_dca) OVER (
    PARTITION BY region
    ORDER BY year_start
  ) AS previous_btc_dca
FROM cte_dollar_cost_average
)
-- final output
SELECT
  year_start,
  region,
  btc_dca,
  dca_ranking,
  ROUND(
    (100 * (btc_dca - previous_btc_dca) / previous_btc_dca)::NUMERIC,
    2
  ) AS dca_percentage_change
FROM cte_window_functions
ORDER BY region, year_start;
