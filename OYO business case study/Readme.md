Database Used - Microsoft SQL Server           
Insights:-

1. Banglore , gurgaon & delhi were popular in the bookings, whereas Kolkata is less popular in bookings
2. Nature of Bookings:         
       
• Nearly 50 % of the bookings were made on the day of check in only.       
• Nearly 85 % of the bookings were made with less than 4 days prior to the date of check in.    
• Very few no.of bookings were made in advance(i.e over a 1 month or 2 months).      
• Most of the bookings involved only a single room.    
• Nearly 80% of the bookings involved a stay of 1 night only.     
           
3. Oyo should acquire more hotels in the cities of Pune, Kolkata & Mumbai. Because their average room rates are comparetively higher so more revenue will come.         
     
4. The % cancellation Rate is high on all 9 cities except pune , so Oyo should focus on finding reasons about cancellation.
