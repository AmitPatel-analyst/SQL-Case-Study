94844,"all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,"
88064,"the other players, and shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her"

76161,"Alice was thoroughly puzzled. ‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated"
14771,"‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice."
45861,"‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said very politely, ‘if"

70408,"things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this"

39839,"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked"

40093,"By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table"

34149,"‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided"

16100,"Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply."
65268,"‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to herself,"

71860,"‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling."
10425,"‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’"
20054,"very little! Besides, SHE’S she, and I’m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling"
44405,"and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into"

56473,"dry enough!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse"

40082,"‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of"
